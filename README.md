db2-bluemix-r
=============

Code for my tests of IBM Bluemix Analytics Warehouse service, now called dashDB (DB2 in-memory database) and R

For documentation see these blog entries:
* [What a plot: DB2, R, and Bluemix help with vacation weather](http://blog.4loeser.net/2014/09/what-plot-db2-r-and-bluemix-help-with.html)
* [Setting up and using a DB2 in-memory database on IBM Bluemix](http://blog.4loeser.net/2014/08/setting-up-and-using-db2-in-memory.html)

I set up a DB2 in-memory database as a service on [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net), uploaded weather data, ran queries, and used the language R to plot some graphs.

Update: I created a new [repository dedicated to dashDB with links to documentation, background, and samples](https://github.com/data-henrik/dashDB-links).
