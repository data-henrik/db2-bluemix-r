=============

Code for my tests of IBM Bluemix Analytics Warehouse service (DB2 in-memory database) and R

For documentation see these blog entries:

* [Setting up and using a DB2 in-memory database on IBM Bluemix](http://blog.4loeser.net/2014/08/setting-up-and-using-db2-in-memory.html)

I set up a DB2 in-memory database as a service on [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net), uploaded weather data, ran queries, and used the language R to plot some graphs.
